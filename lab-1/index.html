                <p><cite>Michael Jordan</cite> â€” <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuXZFQKKF7A">
                    I've missed more than <b>9000</b> shots in my career.I've lost almost <b>300</b> games.<br>
                    <b>26</b> times I was trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.<br>
                    I've failed over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</q></p>

                <h4>My hobbies:</h4>
                <p>Besides programming in my free time, I enjoy building computers and repairing its parts<br> 
                    as well as overclocking PC and optimizing the system. I also attend gym several times a week<br>
                    and enjoy playing basketball with my friends. At home, if I'm not busy with work or study,<br> 
                    I prefer to spend time watching TV series or reading books and playing video games.</p>
